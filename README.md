## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Curious, attentive and always on the lookout for new developments. 
Essentially, front/back developer, I am very focused on industrialization (via CI/CD) and very concerned by the approach/philosophy of Cloud technologies (measurement and analysis of costs by use), this requires us to be better in our choices and in our quality.
